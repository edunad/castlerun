In a far, far away land where people lived happily ever after ruled by the greatest king of all...
It's time to end this fairy tail.
Forged inside the deepest mountain of the underworld, YOU were born.
Being such a fearsome creature you were assigned the task of killing the "great" king who ever lived.
You are as beautiful as Aphrodite, the goddess of beauty.
What should we call you ??
